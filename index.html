        Wow, how did we get here, sitting in a jiu jitsu studio watching my son.

        I've always wanted to write, but never had the balls.  All of my
        influencers are telling me to get into the writting game.  Many are 
        even saying not to worry about what or how to write--just start writing and the right things will start flowing out of you.  Hmm, OK, here goes.  The perspective becomes narrow when you have the mic.

        Who am I, just a dude.  A dude who likes two spaces after his periods, old school.  I like automation technology and the study of relationships, specifically pare bonding and family formation. I am also fond of bio-hacking for the purposses of getting more done.
